# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns.

This report provides insight on data covering several thousand crowdfunding projects through analysis and data visualisation.

---
## Overview of Project

This project attempts to generate insights and trends from analysing several thousand crowdfunding projects on behalf of Louise, who is keen to start a number of fundraising campaign projects. The analysis will focus on attributes that lead to higher success rates in campaigns achieving their fundraising goals. This will allow Louise to optimise her future campaigns and increase their chances of success.

### Purpose

Louise would like to investigate whether certain factors determine or influence the outcome of campaigns. With this in mind, this report will analyse and discuss how campaign launch dates and their funding goals correlate to a campaign's potential success or failure.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

##### Method

To analyse how the launch dates impacted the campaign outcome, the data was formatted in a pivot table. This allows us to filter in data of interest (outcomes) and omit the unnecessary information. Since Louise is interested in the theatre category and launch dates, the parent category and year (year of when campaign was created) were selected in the filters and plotted against outcomes ("successful", "failed", and "cancelled"). A line chart was created to visualise the information.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
